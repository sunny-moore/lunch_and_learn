# README

We would like to see a README file included in your project that outlines the learning goals, how someone can clone and set up your application and where they can get their own API keys, and happy path endpoint use.

## Learning Goals ##
- Expose an API that aggregates data from multiple external APIs
- Expose an API that requires an authentication token
- Expose an API for CRUD functionality
- Determine completion criteria based on the needs of other developers
- Test both API consumption and exposure, making use of at least one mocking tool (VCR, Webmock, etc)
## Setup ##
- clone this repository
- run bundle install
- run rails db:create

## API Keys ##

## Endpoint use ##
